* Design and Development in Operating Systems &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2024.09-present    
  Under the supervision of Prof. Ion Stoica   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Berkeley,USA   
  • Build a shell, similar to the one used by bash on a virtual machine.  
  • Implement an HTTP server that handles HTTP GET requests.   
  • Complete OS development with Pintos       
  
* Simulation and prediction of Pacman’s behavior under different scenarios &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2024.09-present   
  Under the supervision of Prof. Pieter Abbeel   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Berkeley,USA   
  • Build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.    
  • Design agents for the classic version of Pacman.Implement both minimax and expectimax search and evaluation function design.     
  • Implement value iteration and Q-learning. Then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.      
  • Using Bayesian networks and factoring, the implementation progresses from localizing a single stationary ghost to hunting swarms of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency      

* Design and Development of Computer Architecture &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2024.9-2024.11  
  Under the supervision of Prof. Dan Garcia   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Berkeley,USA    
  • Creating a playable snake game in C Programming Language    
  • A simple machine learning algorithm for classifying handwritten digits is implemented using RISC-V assembly code.   
  • Design a skeleton CPU which contains basic elements like ALU, Register File, and expand CPU to support more instructions and pipelining.     
  • Implementing and optimizing 2D convolution.     

* Simulation Implementation of Internet Protocol &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2024.09-2024.10
  Under the supervision of Prof. Rob Shakir   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Berkeley,USA 
  • Implement and enhance existing traceroute implementations to handle various errors that may occur in the network.       
  • Implementing a distance vector routing protocol.       
  • Provide reliability for TCP Protocol, though it won’t include congestion control.       

* Circuit Simulation Design @ XJTU, 2023.11-2023.12   
  • Python   
  • Design class multisim circuit simulation to enable the application of sinusoidal steady state circuit phase method simulation simulation
