* Design and Development in Operating Systems,2024.09-present    
  Under the supervision of Prof. Ion Stoica@Berkeley,USA   
  • Build a shell, similar to the one used by bash on a virtual machine.  
  • Implement an HTTP server that handles HTTP GET requests.   
  • Complete OS development with Pintos       
  
* Simulation and prediction of Pacman’s behavior under different scenarios,2024.09-present   
  Under the supervision of Prof. Pieter Abbeel,Berkeley,USA   
  • Build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.    
  • Design agents for the classic version of Pacman.Implement both minimax and expectimax search and evaluation function design.     
  • Implement value iteration and Q-learning. Then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.      
  • Using Bayesian networks and factoring, the implementation progresses from localizing a single stationary ghost to hunting swarms of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency      

* Design and Development of Computer Architecture,2024.9-2024.11   
  Under the supervision of Prof. Dan Garcia,Berkeley,USA    
  • Creating a playable snake game in C Programming Language    
  • A simple machine learning algorithm for classifying handwritten digits is implemented using RISC-V assembly code.   
  • Design a skeleton CPU which contains basic elements like ALU, Register File, and expand CPU to support more instructions and pipelining.     
  • Implementing and optimizing 2D convolution.     

* Simulation Implementation of Internet Protocol,2024.09-2024.10         
  Under the supervision of Prof. Rob Shakir,Berkeley,USA           
  • Implement and enhance existing traceroute implementations to handle various errors that may occur in the network.       
  • Implementing a distance vector routing protocol.       
  • Provide reliability for TCP Protocol, though it won’t include congestion control.       

* 2D Game Design and Development,2024.03 - 2024.04          
  Under the supervision of Prof. Kelvin Sung,Xi’an, China        
  • A 2D modeling of the campus map was carried out in the form of a team, and the campus terrain was accurately digitized. Based on the profound historical and cultural heritage of the school, creative design and technological implementation were integrated to create a campus themed situational drama 2D interactive game -”Paranormal-XJTU”

* Circuit Simulation Design,2023.11-2023.12        
  Under the supervision of Prof. Shuhong Wang,Xi’an, China         
  • Design class multisim circuit simulation to enable the application of sinusoidal steady state circuit phase method simulation simulation

* Oscillations of a surface-conducting light sphere under a magnetic field,2023.03 - 2024.06          
  Under the supervision of Prof. Shengchun Mao,Xi’an, China         
  • Using software such as Tracker, MATLAB, COMSOL, etc., abstract modeling, data analysis, and formula fitting of physical phenomena are carried out to obtain the motion formula of a surface conductive light ball in a magnetic field under certain conditions.          
  • Complete the group paper ”Study on the Effect of Magnetic Field on the Oscillation of Surface Conductive Light Balls
