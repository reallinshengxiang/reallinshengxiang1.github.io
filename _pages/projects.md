* Design and Development in Operating Systems &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2024.09-present    
  Under the supervision of Prof. Ion Stoica   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Berkeley,USA   
  • Build a shell, similar to the one used by bash on a virtual machine.  
  • Implement an HTTP server that handles HTTP GET requests.   
  • Complete OS development with Pintos       
  
* Simulation and prediction of Pacman’s behavior under different scenarios &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2024.09-present   
  Under the supervision of Prof. Pieter Abbeel   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Berkeley,USA   
  • Build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.    
  • Design agents for the classic version of Pacman.Implement both minimax and expectimax search and evaluation function design.     
  • Implement value iteration and Q-learning. Then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.      
  • Using Bayesian networks and factoring, the implementation progresses from localizing a single stationary ghost to hunting swarms of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency      

* Implementing a Snake Game in C @ UCB, 2024.09  
  • C     
  • Creating a playable snake game in C Programming Language    

* 2D Game Development and Design @ XJTU, 2024.03   
  • C#   
  • Based on game engine Unity, creating Paranormal-XJTU   

* Circuit Simulation Design @ XJTU, 2023.11-2023.12   
  • Python   
  • Design class multisim circuit simulation to enable the application of sinusoidal steady state circuit phase method simulation simulation
