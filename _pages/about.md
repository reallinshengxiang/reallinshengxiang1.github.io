I'm in my final year studying Computer Science at ABC University,where I've specialized in software development and machine learning. My projects haveincluded developing apps that streamline day-to-day activities and creating algorithmsthat predict consumer purchasing behavior. Last summer, I interned at Google, where Icontributed to projects optimizing search algorithms. I'm looking for full-timeopportunities in software engineering or AI development at tech-forward companiessuch as Amazon, Facebook, or IBM. Any introductions to professionals in these companies would be greatly appreciated.
